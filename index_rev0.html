        <h1>Welcome to True Offset!</h1>
        <p>
            True offset is a nonprofit service that sells high quality, solar infrastructure based carbon credits to climate concerned businesses and individuals based on their monthly, lifetime, or trip carbon output. 
        </p>

        <h2>The True Offset Way</h2>
        <h3>Accurately Track Your Carbon Output via the Carbon Profile</h3>
        <h4>The best way to reduce carbon output is to not released in the first place.</h4>
        <p>
            At True Offset, we believe that the first step in solving climate change is understanding our individual and business carbon outputs and making changes to decrease them. By accurately tracking your monthly output and treating True Offset as a voluntary tax, you or your business are incentivised to make changes that will save you money on your voluntary monthly true offset bill. 
        </p>
        <h4>Create Carbon Profile</h4>
        <p>
            Create Carbon Neutral profile to visualize your monthly carbon expenditure by calculating your baseline monthly basic transportation, electricity, and food carbon outputs with some simple questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Complete your Net Zero profile over time by adding previous flights, transportation, electricity and food profiles to complete your profile.
        </p>
        </ul>
        <h4>View Your Carbon Output</h4>
        <p>
            User profile dashboards show improvement over time and projected donations for descisions such as solar roofing or electric vehicle purchase.
        </p>        
        <h4>Select Your Donation Plan</h4>
        <p>
            Decide how much you want to offset and decide how to strucure your dontations.
        </p>
        <h4>Select Which Projects to Fund and Follow!</h4>
        <p>
            Choose between three projects with three projected carbon costs associated with them.
        </p>
        <h4>Follow your chosen funds, donate monthly, and take measures to reduce your carbon bill!</h4>
        <P>
            Profile dashboards show you your progess towards carbon neutrality and project progression and key milestones.
        </P>

        <h2>High Quality Carbon Credits</h2>
        <p>
            The current carbon credit market is rife with low quality carbon credits which <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-climate-solution-actually-adding-millions-of-tons-of-co2-into-the-atmosphere">often cause more harm than good.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Each True Offset project must satisfy the following criteria as defined by the <a href="https://www.offsetguide.org/high-quality-offsets/"> Greenhouse Gas Management Institute and Stockholm Environmental Institute</a>: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Additional</li>
            <li>Not Overestimated</li>
            <li>Permanent</li>
            <li>Not Claimed by Another Entity</li>
            <li>Not Assosciated with Significant Social or Environmental Harms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Through the creation of new and permanent solar and battery infrastructure, True Offset strives to provide, well, true offsets!
        </p>
        <H3>Additional</H3>
        <p> 
            Each True Offset Project creats new after the meter solar and battery infrastructure that is financed via your contributions, these projects cannot exist without your donations. 
        </p>
        <H3> Not Overestimated</H3>
        <p> 
            Each project's offset is calculated by dividing the total cost of the project by the expected lifetime output and the present and future conditions of the local grid.
        </p>
        <H3> Permanent</H3>
        <p>
            Each True Offset Project will be planned from conception to decommissioning and replacement of the old infrastructure. 
        </p>
        <H3>Not Claimed by Another Entity</H3>
        <p>
            Each True Offset carbon credit is certified to be yours only. <a href="https://www.offsetguide.org/high-quality-offsets/exclusive-claim-to-ghg-reductions/">Double issueance, use, and claiming are strictly prohibited.</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Not assosciated with Significant Social or Environmental Harms</h3>
        <p>
            All infrastructure providors and contractors must be vetted to ensure no assosciation with signifiant social or environmental harms.
